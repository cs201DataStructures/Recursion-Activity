     * From codingbat: https://codingbat.com/prob/p107330
     * We have bunnies standing in a line, numbered 1, 2, ... 
     * The odd bunnies (1, 3, ..) have the normal 2 ears. The 
     * even bunnies (2, 4, ..) we'll say have 3 ears, because 
     * they each have a raised foot. Recursively return the 
     * number of "ears" in the bunny line 1, 2, ... n (without 
     * loops or multiplication).
     * Example input and expected output:
     *    bunnyEars2(0) → 0
     *    bunnyEars2(1) → 2
     *    bunnyEars2(2) → 5
     * You can copy and paste your code into codingbat
     * to test further. Note that on codingbat, the
     * method must be non-static rather than static.
     * Nothing else about your implementation needs to
     * change to test it there.
